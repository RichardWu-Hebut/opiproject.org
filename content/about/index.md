The objective of the OPI Project is to foster a community-driven
standards-based open ecosystem for next generation architectures and frameworks
based on DPU/IPU-like technologies.

To achieve this goal, OPI is being formed by the merge of two projects:
* [Diamond Bluff](https://diamond-bluff.github.io)
* [IPDK](https://ipdk.io)
